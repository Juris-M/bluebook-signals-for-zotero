Bluebook Signals for Zotero
============

Bluebook Signals for Zotero adds a pulldown menu of standard Bluebook signals in the prefix field of the word processor integration plugin widgets supplied by Zotero or MLZ.

To download the add-on and for instructions see the project [webpage](http://fbennett.github.io/bluebook-signals-for-zotero/)

It's a pretty simple thing, but patches, pull requests and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
